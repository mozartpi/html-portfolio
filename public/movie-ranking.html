<h1>The Best Movies According to Mozart</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Back to the Future</h3>
<p>Favourite of all time. Sci-Fi, comedy and some drama, for an eleven years old boy, it was really perfect!!</p>
<h3>King Richard</h3>
<p>A movie that tells you to go forward, believe in your dreams, find the help you need and do not give up!</p>
<h3>Spider-Man (Sam Raimi)</h3>
<p>A great superheroe film. At my late 20's, it was great to see one of my favourite characters on live action, in a great story!</p>
